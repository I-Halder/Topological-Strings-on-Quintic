# Topological-Strings-on-Quintic

## Folder P
This file contains information for the free energy of topological strings up to genus 49. In addition, it contains some information on the moduli space geometry (degree 1 to 11, genus 2 to 13). For more information on moduli space geometry see the file ABGt.mx.
The files in the folder P can be used as follows:
  1. Download the files in a local folder called "P". In MacOS, open the terminal and access the folder "P"
  2. Use the following command (this creates a Mathematica readable file named P.mx): **cat * > P.mx**
  3. Copy the Mathematica file named "example.nb" available here in folder "P" and follow the instructions in it.

## File gv.csv
This file contains Gopakumar-Vafa coefficients for quintic. Each column represents data for a given genus (0 to 49), and each row corresponds to a particular degree (1 to 21).

## File quintic.m
This is the actual Mathematica file we used for the calculation. An initial version of it was written by IH, and the current optimized form is due to YL.
